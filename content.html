          <p>So, I decided I wanted to code my own website. I like learning how to do things, I could do that......You have this fuzzy vision in your minds eye of what your all-singing-all-dancing website will look like, but after barely half an hour trawling youtube tutorials you realise that your vision is a distant one.  Its emphemeral form means it isn't up to even expert coding as you realise that the process of getting your site together is as much about content creation and site design as writing code.
When you are learning something you want some immediate results to show for you efforts. Sure, you could steal someone elses pictures, throw them into an off the shelf template in a drag'n drop site builder, but would that really satisfy?  Would you learn much? Would that progress you towards realising the vision, however blurred, that started you off?  Thinking of something simple but meaningful motivate and get you started can be strangely elusive.
I decieded that my first website would be be a demonstration of and comentary on my learning journey.  Each new step would create more content by example and explanation.  Are you ready to take the journey.......
